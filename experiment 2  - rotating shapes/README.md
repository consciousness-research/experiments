## About experiment 2

Set up a model that can detect if an rotated shape on the right is the same as the shape on the left: 

[The illusion of consciousness | Dan Dennett | Rotating Shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjbWr3ODbAo&feature=youtu.be&t=819)

Objectives:
- Understand what type of intelligence architecture is used to replicate this experiment
- Understand the inner logic or thinking process of the model 
- Understand what the limitations are
