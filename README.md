## About CORE

The Consciousness Origination Research Endeavour [CORE] is a non-profit research group that is trying to understand consciousness by doing small machine learning experiments. We build on the latest research insights in neuroscience, psychology and computer science. The aim of this project is to shed light on the parts related to human consciousness and thereby learn how it is working. We believe the only way to unravel the mysteries of human consciousness is to use machine learning asa kind of Lego blocks to solve this puzzle one step at the time. All code is open and free to use for everyone. 

In order to get invited for the CORE group on Slack please send an email to thomas.schijf@gmail.com with your motivations to join the community. When added, you are able to attend our monthly online sessions where we discuss with the outcome of experiments and develop new ones. 

- UPDATE: Next session: Sat. 3 Oct. 2020 12:00 CEST
