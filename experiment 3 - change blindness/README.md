Set up a photo captioning model that does not recognizing the changed color over time, but is recognizing the change when compared the end with the begin state: 

[AI Cognition Won't Work for Consciousness | Ned Block | Change blindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjbWr3ODbAo&feature=youtu.be&t=665)
   
Objectives:
- Understand what type of intelligence architecture is used to replicate this experiment
- Understand under what conditions machine intelligence will just like the human brain not conceptialize color 
- Understand what the model limitations are

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Watch the Youtube video about Ned Block's experiment
2. Inspect the contents of the data and literature folders
3. Initialize a Jupiter Notebook in the code folder
4. Share your contributions and get invited for the CORE group on Slack (see general README)
