## About experiment 1

Set up a human detection model trained on human silhouettes that will classify the dots on Bellotto's bridge painting as humans: 

[The illusion of consciousness | Dan Dennett | Bellotto's bridge painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjbWr3ODbAo&feature=youtu.be&t=665)
   
Objectives:
- Understand what type of intelligence architecture is used to replicate this experiment
- Understand under what conditions machine intelligence will generalize
- Understand what the model limitations are
